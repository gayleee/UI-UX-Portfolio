However, there are three major problems: Unclear visual hierarchy, High interaction cost, and an overloaded cognitive load.

The solution is to separate them into two sides and condense the method into one preparation point (a kiosk) and use F-pattern layout. It allows the players to naturally scan categories and ingredients that is placed near each other.`,

At first, I placed the search function within the top navigation bar. However, due to the project's requirement that we create a single artboard per screen only, I instead made a dedicated search section beneath the navigation bar; see Figure 1.4.

This familiar structure immediately places the user in a comfortable environment, especially for the target audience.

The color scheme is simple: the 60-30-10 rule is applied. I also went with the color red to signify passion for niches and how people are willing to go to find a community that they can learn and strive with, all for the love of their interests.

This led to a crucial learning moment: we over-prioritized visual appeal, resulting in non-compliant UX practices. Specifically, retaining the original brand color as the primary scheme led to a contrast score of 4.82, failing to meet full accessibility standards. Furthermore, feedback indicated that the page structure was too dense, affirming the need to shorten the homepage to improve customer engagement and retention.

The second iteration successfully addressed the page length constraint, distilling content to its essential, straight-to-the-point elements. However, this pivot introduced a new challenge: a brand-to-product misalignment. The design visually suggested the company sold abstract digital or technological products, failing to immediately showcase the core service—solar energy installations. This lack of visual context on the landing page risked creating customer skepticism.

1. Accessibility and SEO best practices: Relying solely on images to convey project information—a “burned-in” or “baked-in” text (text is part of the image itself and has no alternative text)—creates accessibility barriers and risks a poor user experience on slow connections. Additionally, this information blocks the visual assets and prevents the visitor from viewing the whole image, and the text heavily relies on an overlay to be clearly read. When it comes to SEO, search engines cannot index burned-in information.

In order to solve this problem, we came up with various design sprint but we felt something is lacking. See figure 1.4`,

However, implementing an unfamiliar framework while managing the design phase introduced technical friction. Simultaneously upskilling and adhering to our design challenged our project timeline. As we deepened our understanding of the framework’s component logic, our UI components pivoted to align with the framework's limitations. 

For instance, we wanted to add icons to our lesson and quiz buttons, but as simple as it sounds, it gave us narrow options: 1.) Kivy does not natively allow icons on rounded buttons. 2.) Those buttons that allow icons have strict position requirements. This is only one of the predicaments we faced that challenged our design. In this particular example, we already established rounded buttons across the app, which resulted in either the app crashing or us adjusting the design that did not adhere to the global style; we chose the latter; see Figure 1.`,

At first, we as a group gathered ideas on what the best AI solution to integrate was. With difficulty and availability considered, we ultimately opted for an AI that uses the camera to detect facial expressions and determine emotions shown; however, as the project scope requirements were finalized, we opted for an AI that recognizes speech; see Figure 1.4.

However, as we continued to consult our client, we came up with lesson and quiz gameplay based on articulation hierarchy and ensured that we made it simple and easy to follow. Each lesson chapter is based on the level in the articulation hierarchy. The articulation hierarchy is a structured approach in speech therapy to teach a child to produce a sound correctly.

However, due to the project scope limitation, we opt for 4 out of 8 levels. Each chapter follows this sequence: Discrimination > Isolation > Syllables > Words. The first level, discrimination, is the step where the correct sound and the sound they make must be distinguished. Isolation is the stage where a child must produce the sound by itself. Syllables are the stages where sounds and vowels (vowel-consonant (VC) or consonant-vowel (CV)) combine. Lastly, words are the stage where a child must practice using sounds in words.

The goal is to not only help the user speak a word correctly but also help them physically practice it through visuals and AI speech recogniztion system; see Figure 1.5.`,
